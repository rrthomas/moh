      In a world where the extremes of poverty and disease have been all but eliminated, what price a human soul? \emph{Mother of Hydrogen} shows us a future in which a state that’s not exactly totalitarian has given much of the planet a life that’s entirely bearable, and asks: how much is freedom really worth paying for? When there was no Faustian bargain to create a utopia, just a general agreement that a safer, more comfortable existence is worth paying for, how much compromise is too much?
